# Loan-Status-Prediction-Support-Vector-Machine-
This project aims to predict loan status by utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The historical loan data is preprocessed, and the SVM model is trained and fine-tuned using labeled data. The study focused on building machine learning model using the SVM algorithm from the scikit-learn library.
